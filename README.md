This lesson is designed to further our knowledge of integrating Ruby code with
Html. Put in transactions (deposits/withdrawals) and the app will keep track of all your transactions. It uses one data table of transactions, simple edit/create forms, and a total amount displayed on the home page.

Features

The app assumes that there is only one way to use money...you spend it or you deposit it. There are not different ways to spend money (i.e. checks, cash, debit card). Once a transaction is created, the database is updated and the following statistics are updated:

The total amount of money in the account (whether that is a positive amount or a negative amount).
The total number of transactions on the account.
Gives you the user a sarcastic remark of you've exceeded your funds available!
